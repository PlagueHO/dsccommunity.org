## Welcome, and thanks for paying us visit !

Welcome to our community portal where we share who's behind the community and how we try to organize ourselves.

In this section, you will find information about the steering committee, the best place to find help, how to ask a question, how you can contribute, and where to look for documentation.

If any documentation about the community is missing (not about the [DSC framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview/overview) or other [solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration)), feel free to raise an issue in [this website's GitHub project](https://github.com/dsccommunity/dsccommunity.org/issues).
