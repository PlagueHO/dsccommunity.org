## The Decision Process

The DSC committee is a steering committee that makes decisions affecting the organization and the DSC Resources it owns.

The goal of this organization and new approach is to not be blocked by the lack of availability of one of its member.

To do so, requests should be suggested by writing in the **DSC Community RFC** repository of the **DSC Community** GitHub organization, and **can** be considered approved 72 hours after submission **unless someone objected explicitly** (i.e. "_I Object this decision ... [unless|until]..._"), or **requested a change** in a PR review.

Some specific exceptions to this system will apply and be listed as we evolve, such as the eviction of a Member requiring an active Majority (or something similar to be discussed).

## Appointing the initial Committee

Although we want the election process to evolve and be more open over time, the initial committee is appointed based on contributions to the DSC Community and the DSC Resource Kit.

There are a few reasons why we opted to appoint the initial members instead of creating an election process. Although the DSC Community Organization is new, it's a continuation of the ideas and spirit of the DSC Resource Kit, in a more flexible format.

We want the transition to be swift and smooth, and we did not want to struggle with an election process, as the community is not yet organized for this approach, or a large committee that increases side communication and delays.

The DSC Resource Kit was already operating under similar structure, but it wasn't official or formalized, and Johan and Daniel were not given enough GitHub permissions to have smooth and bottleneck-free administration.

## Initial Members

**Katie** is the **owner of the Resource Kit at Microsoft** and has steered its directions over the years. She's also an active member of the Engineering team at Microsoft looking after all things DSC and Guest Configuration, and can bridge the communication between the new products and features leveraging DSC and the DSC Community.

**Michael** is a long time contributor to the DSC Resource Kit, and the **Product Manager for Azure Guest Configuration**. He's well positioned to translate customer needs and requirements back to the community, or from the community back to Microsoft, and share the position or directions taken internally.

**Daniel** has been a long time contributor to the DSC Resource Kit, and if you had anything to do on the GitHub repository, you most likely have came across his work. Not only he is maintaining a few High Quality Resource Module, he consistently produce a massive efforts to help review other Pull Request and improve the testing and quality of the Resource Kit.

**Johan** is also a top contributor and maintains some of the most actives Resources, while joining Daniel in reviewing code across all other repositories and improving the experience and quality of the DSC Resource Kit. Johan also helps new contributors and maintainers to get up to speed, and any DSC user in the [Slack PowerShell #DSC channel](https://powershell.slack.com).
